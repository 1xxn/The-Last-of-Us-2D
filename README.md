# The-Last-of-Us-2D
A simple The Last of Us 2D prototype made with Java LWJGL, available for everyone. It's open source so feel free to use the code, but I would appreciate it to give credits. :)

# Tech
This game uses Java as language and LWJGL as Java Game Library.

# CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT
I'm hard-working to get this prototype done asap. After that I'll extend the game with more features and levels.

# CREDITS
Credits will appear here when everything is finished.
